						<h3 class="services__title">What is Therapy?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							Therapy is a type of treatment that helps people deal with their emotions, thoughts, and
							behaviors. It can be done alone, in groups, or with a partner, and is usually led by a
							trained professional like a therapist, counselor, or psychologist.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							During therapy, you'll talk about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with your
							therapist. They'll help you identify patterns in your behavior or thinking that might be
							causing problems in your life. Together, you'll develop strategies to help you manage these
							issues and improve your overall well-being.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							There are different types of therapy. Individual therapy is when you work one-on-one with a
							therapist. This type of therapy is often helpful for people who want to work through
							personal issues or explore their thoughts and emotions in a private setting. Group therapy
							involves working with a group of people and a therapist to address common issues or
							concerns. This can be a helpful way to connect with others who are going through similar
							experiences and learn from each other's perspectives. Couples therapy involves working with
							a therapist to improve your relationship. This type of therapy can be helpful for couples
							who are struggling with communication, trust, or other issues.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Therapy can be helpful for a wide range of issues such as anxiety, depression, stress,
							trauma, and relationship problems. It can help you better understand yourself and your
							emotions, develop coping strategies, and improve your overall quality of life. Remember that
							therapy is a collaborative process, and you and your therapist work together to achieve your
							goals.

						<h3 class="services__title">What is CBT?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It's a type of therapy that helps people
							improve their mental health and well-being by changing negative thoughts and behaviors.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							In CBT, the therapist and client work together to identify negative thoughts and beliefs.
							They then work on developing new, more positive ways of thinking and behaving. The goal is
							to help the client become more aware of their thoughts and feelings and to learn how to
							change unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior that may be making them feel bad.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected.
							Changing one can lead to changes in the others. During therapy, specific techniques and
							strategies are used to help the client reach their goals.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							CBT can be used to treat many mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD,
							and OCD. It can be used on its own or with medication. Many people have found CBT to be
							helpful in improving their mental health and overall well-being.

						<h3 class="services__title">What is Mindfulness?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to the present moment without getting distracted by
							other things or judging yourself. It involves being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and
							body sensations. You can practice mindfulness using different techniques like meditation,
							breathing exercises, or yoga.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							The goal of mindfulness is to help you develop a sense of peace and clarity in your daily
							life by becoming more aware of your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Research has shown
							that mindfulness can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve emotional regulation, and
							enhance overall well-being.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Even though mindfulness has its origins in Buddhist meditation practices, it has been
							adapted and incorporated into many different fields, including psychology, medicine, and
							education. There are several mindfulness-based interventions and programs available, such as
							Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Practicing mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment, accepting your thoughts and
							emotions without judgment, and becoming more aware of how they affect your behavior.
							Mindfulness can be practiced on your own, with a group, or with a therapist, and can be
							useful for anyone who wants to improve their mental and physical health. As your therapist,
							I can help guide you in practicing mindfulness and integrating it into your daily life.

						<h3 class="services__title">Bereavement Support</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							If you are struggling with grief and bereavement, please know that you are not alone.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Losing a loved one is one of the most difficult experiences we can face in life. The process
							of grief and bereavement can be overwhelming and isolating, and it is important to have
							support during this time.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Together, we can work towards healing and finding meaning in the midst of loss. Whether you
							have experienced recent loss or are still struggling with unresolved grief from the past, I
							am here to provide a safe and compassionate space to process your emotions and work through
							your grief.
						</p>

						<p class="services__description">
							During therapy sessions, we will explore the unique challenges of your grief journey,
							including feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, and anxiety. We will also work together to
							identify healthy coping mechanisms and self-care strategies to help you manage your emotions
							and maintain your well-being.
						</p>

						<p class="services__description">
							My approach to bereavement support is person-centered and tailored to the specific needs and
							goals of each individual. I understand that everyone's experience of grief is unique, and I
							will work with you to create a treatment plan that fits your needs.

						<h3 class="services__title">What is ERP?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							ERP stands for Exposure and Response Prevention, which is a type of cognitive-behavioral
							therapy (CBT) used to treat anxiety disorders, particularly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
							(OCD).
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							In ERP therapy, the client is gradually exposed to situations or objects that trigger their
							anxiety, and then encouraged to resist engaging in the compulsive behaviors that they might
							typically use to reduce their anxiety. By practicing exposure to anxiety-provoking
							situations and learning to resist the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors, clients can
							reduce their anxiety over time.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							ERP therapy typically involves a series of gradual exposure exercises, starting with less
							intense situations and gradually progressing to more challenging situations, as the client's
							anxiety decreases. The therapist will provide guidance and support throughout the process,
							and may also help the client develop coping strategies and other skills to manage anxiety
							and prevent relapse after therapy is complete.

						<h3 class="services__title">What is an Eclectic Approach?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							An eclectic approach is a therapeutic approach that involves using techniques and strategies
							from multiple different therapeutic modalities, rather than adhering strictly to one
							particular model or theory of therapy.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							An eclectic therapist may draw on elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),
							psychodynamic therapy, humanistic therapy, and other approaches, depending on the needs of
							the client and the goals of the therapy. The therapist may use different techniques and
							strategies at different times during the therapy, depending on what seems most effective in
							the moment.

						<h3 class="services__title">What is an Strengths-based Approach?</h3>
						<p class="services__description">
							A strengths-based approach is a way of doing therapy that focuses on what you're good at and
							what you're good at doing, instead of just looking at your weaknesses or problems. The idea
							is that everyone has things they're good at, and if we focus on those things, we can help
							you feel better and be more successful.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							When we use a strengths-based approach, we'll work together to figure out what your
							strengths and skills are, and how we can use them to help you achieve your goals and feel
							better about yourself. We'll focus on finding solutions and strategies that build on your
							strengths, rather than just trying to fix your weaknesses.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							This approach can be especially helpful if you're feeling down on yourself or if you've been
							through some tough times. By focusing on your strengths, we can help you see yourself in a
							more positive light and feel more hopeful about the future.
						</p>
						<p class="services__description">
							Remember, a strengths-based approach isn't a specific type of therapy, but rather a way of
							working with you that emphasizes your unique strengths and abilities, and uses those as a
							foundation for positive change and growth.
